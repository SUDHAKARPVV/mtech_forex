    (sign-agreement) hinge penalty.

    Huber replaces plain MSE after the hourly-scale round showed the model
    chasing volatility spikes: with squared error, one 3-sigma bar
    outweighs dozens of ordinary bars, so training gradients are dominated
    by exactly the unpredictable jumps the model should NOT fit. Huber is
    quadratic near zero and linear beyond delta -- the industry-standard
    robust loss for financial return targets. Inputs arrive here already
    scaled by return_scale (see total_loss), so delta=1.0 means "one
    representative return magnitude": ordinary bars stay in the quadratic
    regime, spikes get a bounded, linear gradient.

    Pure MSE can be minimised by predictions that are small and correctly
    *scaled* but wrong in *sign* -- exactly the failure mode the initial
    evaluation run showed (low MAE, ~50% directional accuracy). The second
    term, relu(-pred * target), is zero whenever pred and target already
    agree in sign (regardless of magnitude, so it never rewards inflating
    predictions purely to "look more confident"), and grows linearly with
    the size of the disagreement when they don't. Because pred and target
    are both in log-return units, this term is naturally the same order of
    magnitude as the MSE term, so it nudges the model toward getting the
    *direction* right without needing any hand-tuned scale constant (an
    earlier tanh-saturation version of this loss did need one, and got it
    wrong -- it dominated the MSE term and caused prediction magnitudes to
    blow up while barely improving directional accuracy; kept as a cautionary
    note for anyone modifying this function).
